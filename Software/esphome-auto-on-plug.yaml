# Important note: There are always risks associated with turning off power to a device without an ordered shutdown having first being completed. These risks are present when using this sketch.

#
# In more detail 
#
# This software automatically turns on a SONOFF S31 Lite power plug's relay when it is first plugged in, and also back on 30 seconds anytime after the relay is turned off (assuming the S31 remains powered).
#
# Recommendation for first time use:
#
# Ensure the device running this software has access to Home Assistant at the location it will be used.
#
# To do this is to plug the device running this software into to the power outlet that you intended to use with it, but do not yet plug anything into the device running this software.
#
# Next, use ESPHOME's log feature to view the logs of the device running this software to confirm that this device is connecting though to Home Assistant.
#
# Next, turn the device off either manually by pushing its button or add it to your Home Assistant dashboard and turn it off via the dashboard.  Once done wait 30 seconds and the relay should switch back on.
